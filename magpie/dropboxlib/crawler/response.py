    Parameters:
    `response_dict` -- a Python dictionary like the following example.
    The `entries` key contains a set of up to about 1k entries, where each entry is a file
    added or removed to Dropbox by its owner. Each of this entry will be mapped to a

    The `has_more` key shows whether the response is not complete, by meaning that more items
    will be included in the response to the next update query.
