MOOGLE PROJECT
==============

Imagine you want to search for that sushi restaurant someone recommended you last month: you type
"sushi restaurant" in your laptop and you get a tweet from a friend about
Tokyo Sushi. You also get a comment you wrote on Facebook, an SMS message you sent your girlfriend
and a bookmark in your browser, all about the same restaurant. And imagine that you can do this
with your smart phone, your laptop, tablet or smart TV. Something so basic yet so far from
the reality...
This is **Moogle - My Own Google**, the search engine for *private data*.

The project has 2 main components:

- **moogle**: a website which provides the main user interface.
- **magpie**: the core engine which crawls and index private data from service providers.

Follow the steps written in the README.md files in `magpie` and `moogle` folder in order to
create a *local development* copy.

**NOTE**: The project is still in its early stages.
